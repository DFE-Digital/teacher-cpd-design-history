## About the A to Z

The CPD glossary covers terminology, definitions and usage conventions for content published on external CPD service, internal admin interfaces and documentation arranged alphabetically.

If there’s language that is not covered here, check the [DfE content guidelines.](https://design.education.gov.uk/content-design/language-we-use/)

## A 

### Academic year

The year ECTs start their induction and are registered on the Manage training for early career teachers service. 

Note, some schools use the term ‘cohort’ but this should be avoided where possible on CPD services.

### Additional support offer (ASO)

A targeted support package for teachers new to the role of headship. [Read more on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-reforms/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-reforms#additional-support-offer-for-the-npq-in-headship)

## B

## C

### Call-off contract 

### Cohort 

### Continuing professional development (CPD)

The umbrella term for all types of professional development.

### Core induction programme (CIP) 

An **internal term** for where schools deliver ECF-based training using DfE-accredited materials.

Schools who choose this option must use materials from one of 4 lead providers. The materials are quality assured by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF). Appropriate bodies will fidelity check programmes to make sure they cover the full depth of the ECF.

## D

### Database of qualified teachers (DQT)

An internal term used for the database of records of qualified teachers, managed by the Teacher Regulation Agency (TRA).

### Declaration

Declarations are notifications submitted by providers via the API. 

Declarations are submitted where there is evidence of participant engagement for a specific milestone period. They are the sole means for triggering output payments from DfE to a lead provider for a participant for a given milestone. 

Use this term in lead provider facing content. Do not use this term in school or participant facing content.

### Declaration state

Declarations can have one of the following states according to their payment eligibility and their payment status. States can be submitted; eligible; ineligible; voided; payable; paid; awaiting_clawback; clawed_back.

### Declaration type 

Specific types of declarations need to be submitted by lead providers inline with milestone dates and according to the participant’s progress through their training. Declaration types can be started; retained 1; retained 2; retained 3; retained 4; completed.

## E

### Early career framework (ECF)

The framework which sets out what early career teachers are entitled to learn about and learn how to do when they start their careers. It underpins the entitlement for 2 years of professional development designed to help early career teachers develop their practice, knowledge and working habits.

### ECF-based training 

The preferred user-facing term for the ECF programme of study. 

**Note,** ECF-based training is not the same as [statutory induction](#statutory-induction). ECF-based training is one part of statutory induction, though the 2 terms are often used interchangeably.

### Early career teacher (ECT)

Term for those in their first 2 years in teaching. The term has replaced newly qualified teacher (NQT).

### Early headship coaching offer

Structured support and networking opportunities for headteachers in their first 5 years of headship.

### Eligibility criteria

To check whether a ECF participant (ECT or mentor) is eligible for funding, we check the Database of Qualified Teachers (DQT) and our own database to make sure the participant meets the criteria for funded training or access to materials. 

#### ECT checks:

1. Their qualified teacher status (QTS)
2. They formally started their statutory induction after 1 September 2021 (the date the statutory changes came into effect)
3. They have not already started their induction
4. They're required to serve statutory induction
5. There are no serious flags against the teacher’s record

#### Mentor checks:

1. They have a valid TRN
2. They have not already started their mentor training
3. There are no serious flags against the teacher's record

The most common reason this is shown as a validation status is because the induction start date hasn’t been registered with the appropriate body. However, this does not prevent ECTs from starting their training.

## F

### Full induction programme (FIP)

An **internal term** for where a lead provider and a delivery partner provide ECF-based training directly to ECTs and mentors. This option is fully funded by DfE, so there are no costs for eligible schools.

FIP programme include self-study alongside face-to-face/video training elements. Materials are hosted on lead provider platforms.

### Sandbox

A test environment which allows school induction tutors, lead providers and software vendors to test the Manage teacher CPD service. 

The sandbox environment is commonly used by lead providers to test their API integrations without affecting real data.

### School induction tutor (SIT)

The person nominated by the school who coordinates ECF-based registration. They add ECT and mentor details to the service. They’re responsible for the monitoring and support of ECTs. They also manage progress reviews and coordinate formal assessments. 

They’re also known as induction tutors. Some schools use the term induction coordinators, but this is not the preferred term.

### Statutory induction

A mandatory requirement for teachers to complete a 2-year programme of study.

* Statutory - a legal requirement
* Induction - entry to a profession

Although usually applied to newly qualified teachers starting their teaching career from 1 September 2021, it is a requirement of all teachers who are employed in certain school types (for example, Local Authority maintained schools and non-maintained special schools). For example, if a teacher qualified in 2016 and had been working in an academy ever since, they would have to complete induction if they then started to work in a maintained school.

This 2 year programme provides teachers with:

* a 2-year programme of ECF-based training
* support from a dedicated mentor
* time off timetable for induction activities, including ECF-based training and mentor sessions
* regular progress reviews and 2 formal assessments against the teachers' standards

**Note,** statutory induction is not the same as ECF-based training. ECF-based training is one part of statutory induction, though the 2 terms are often used interchangeably.
