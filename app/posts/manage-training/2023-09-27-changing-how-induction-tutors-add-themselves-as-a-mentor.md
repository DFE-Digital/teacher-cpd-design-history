We removed an option for induction tutors to add themselves as a mentor.

Induction tutors can still add themselves as a mentor using the normal “add mentor” flow, but we now present them with an interstitial page to remind them of the difference between the two roles.

## The issue

Previously, when adding an early career teacher (ECT) or a mentor, we had a third option to allow school induction tutors to add themselves as a mentor.

However, the [guidance for the early career framework](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-set-up-training-for-early-career-teachers#nominate-an-induction-tutor) states encourages schools not to combine the two roles of the induction tutor and the mentor:

> #### Who to choose as a mentor
> Try to choose someone who is not also the induction tutor. The 2 roles have separate and different responsibilities.

## What we changed

We removed the option for induction tutors to add themselves as a mentor:

![Screenshot with the title “Who do you want to add?” with radio button options for just 'ECT' and 'Mentor'](updated-who-do-you-want-to-add.png "The new “Who do you want to add?” screen")

However, induction tutors can still add themselves as a mentor by using the “Add mentor” flow, and entering their own details.

When this happens, we now present them with an interstitial screen advising them that the two roles are separate. The can then choose whether or not to continue.

If the induction tutor tries to add themselves as an early career teacher, we prevent this from happening, as this is strictly against the policy framework. Instead, we check whether they had meant to add themselves as a mentor, or would prefer to cancel.

## Next steps

We will monitor this impact this has on school induction tutors adding themselves as a mentor.
