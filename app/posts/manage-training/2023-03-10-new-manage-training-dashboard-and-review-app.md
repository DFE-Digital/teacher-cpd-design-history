## Background
This work addresses the need for a cohortless dashboard that supports schools and teachers in accessing training and information for the early career framework (ECF). The new dashboard design focuses on improving accessibility, usability, and communication, with key principles such as minimising complexity, displaying outstanding actions, and providing clear content. This video offers a brief introduction to the new dashboard design.

### Design summary

The new design is a clean minimalist interface that hides all unnecessary information and only displays the most important information and functionality.

### Design detail
Starting from the top of the page, after the school name, we have: a clear primary call to action with the add ECT or mentor button, a simple list of mentors which clearly displays their associated ECTs nested underneath them. The list is divided into thematic groups with the subtle use of horizontal rules.

In the left column, we can clearly see each participant's name which is presented with the hyperlink. Other than the green button above, there are no other places to click on the page, so  there should be no confusion as to what to click on, other than the participants names.

In the right column that participant's status is displayed using color coded tags.

A significant amount of work has been done on completely reworking the status names, making them more descriptive and easier to understand as current statuses do cause a lot of confusion. 

The design is fully responsive as a mobile as a mobile first design approach was used.

Clicking on a name, displays the participant page, which has also been reworke.

For mentors we can now see more information regarding their status. And we can also see who they are mentoring and can change who they are mentoring.

For ECTs, we can also see more information regarding their status. And we can see who is mentoring them, which we can also change.

Here's an example of how the dashboard now highlights at the top of the page with the warning component, any ECT that is unassigned. The SIT can instantly assign a mentor to an ECT after which they will be displayed nested under that mentor with the warning gone as that task is now complete. 


### New ways of working
During the design process, the team developed a collaborative approach using Figjam boards to share the iterations with the wider team. Team members provided feedback and identified conflicting views. Although useful, managing all the comments was time consuming.

The team also piloted a new way of prototyping, by working closely with developers to build a review app off the dev branch. This allowed us to access real accurate data of testing, which is better than using hard coded or dynamic data in a prototype. If successful, the design could be instantly deployed saving time.

Although the prototype kit still has its place for user and custom component testing, for complex work like this, prototyping and testing using a review app made more sense. 

We've only just started our user research on this and so far, the feedback has been excellent.


### Solution
We developed new screens and implemented logic to handle scenarios where the LP/DP combination is no longer available. This involved designing a new page to notify the SIT about the change in circumstances and providing them with alternative options. These options included forming a new partnership, delivering their own programme using DfE accredited materials, or designing and delivering their own programme based on the Early Career Framework (ECF).


### Outcome and Learnings
This was a very large piece of work and was done at speed to make the deadline. Upon recent design review, we can already see areas for improvements still, and further iterations will be made after the next round of user research is complete. 

Lastly, the new way of working with a big change of team and we identified some minor areas that could be improved, which we will factor in next time.

Overall though, the new ways of working and the results that came from it, so far, have been very successful.
