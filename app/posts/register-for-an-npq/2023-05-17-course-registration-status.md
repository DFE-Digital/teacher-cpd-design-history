## Problem statement

Users who want to study a different NPQ from the one they registered for, need to submit a new registration or raise a ticket with support. This increases the work of support agents and takes more time from the user.

## Design

We have designed a journey so the user can self-serve when they need to change their NPQ. The journey below shows the process the user needs to follow to make the changes.

The screens are the same screens they go through in the registration process.

In some work settings (i.e. ITT mentor and private early years) changing the NPQ will affect their eligibility for funding (see journey).

In other cases, the provider previously chosen might not deliver the new NPQ. In this instance the user will need to choose a different provider (see journey).

Once they've made all the changes, they can amend the NPQ in the check and confirm page (see screenshot).

Finally, once they complete the changes they can go back to the registration status page using the link on the confirmation page (see screenshot "Confirmation page").
