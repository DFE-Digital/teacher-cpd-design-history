## Issue 1

A couple of users reported feeling uncertain about whether they were selecting the right NPQ, because the names or abbreviations look alike.

### Hypotheses

Removing the repetition of 'NPQ' and the acronyms from the radio options will make the NPQs easier to differentiate from one another.

## Issue 2

Some users do not realise that registering is not the same as applying.

### Hypotheses

Sentences like 'What are you applying for?' could re-enforce the perception that you're applying, when in fact you're just registering.

## Issue 3

Important information about the early headship coaching offer is contained in the details component.

The government digital service (GDS) states that some people do not click on this component because they worry that it's a link that might take them away from their transaction.

Take-up for the early headship coaching offer is low.

### Hypotheses

Bringing out the information about early headship coaching offer from the details component will make it more likely to be seen.

This could be an opportunity to increase awareness of the early headship coaching offer.
