## Context

The NPQ admin console was redesigned to reduce reliance on developers and give internal users more control. It supports teams across the Department for Education (DfE), including digital, policy, assurance, and contract management.

The console helps manage NPQ applications and registrations. Once a user engages with their NPQ course provider or the registration service, eligibility checks and declaration submissions processes are triggered.

Admin users can now:

- [Search and filter applications and registration](#search-and-filter-applications-and-registration)
- [View declaration details and state history](#view-declaration-details-and-state-history)
- [View course outcome](#view-course-outcome)
- [View application history](#view-application-history)
- [View course details](#view-course-details)
- [Download, freeze or save financial statements](#download%2C-freeze-or-save-financial-statements)
- [Make adjustments to financial statements](#make-adjustments-to-financial-statements)
- [Change contract information](#change-contract-information)
- [Search for workplace details](#search-for-workplace-details)
- [View provider and delivery partner relationships](#view-provider-and-delivery-partner-relationships)
- [Manage delivery partners](#manage-delivery-partners)
- [Make bulk changes](#make-bulk-changes)

## What admins can now do

#### Submit declarations for providers

Super admin users can submit declarations for providers in case there are outstanding declarations once they roll off the NPQ programme. This ensures accurate data for the DfE and enables users to receive their certificates.
