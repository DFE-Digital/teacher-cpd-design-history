## Background

The National Award for SENCO (NASENCO) was a mandatory qualification for those who wanted to become a SENCO in a mainstream school. This qualification has since been discontinued, and the new SENCO NPQ has been introduced as a replacement.  

From September 2024, all SENCOs and aspiring SENCOs will need to: 

- take the NPQ if they have not completed or started the NASENCO 

- complete training within 3 years of appointment - schools and SENCOs must make sure they enrol on training that will meet this requirement 

SENCOs appointed before 1 September 2009 or those who completed the previous NASENCO qualification are not required to take the NPQ. But aspiring or current SENCOs who were appointed after this date and without the NASENCO will be expected to, to ensure compliance with the regulations. 

## Changes we made 

### Guidance page

With input from our policy team and Digi-comms, we drafted and published a new guidance page which introduced the new SENCO course. This was published alongside the other NPQs on the gov.uk website.  

During this time, a review of our funding policy was in progress which meant that we were unable to fully explain the funding eligibility for this course. Whilst the funding decision was imminent, we decided to run user testing sessions to test whether the SENCO guidance page is accessible and effective. 

### NPQ Registration service flow 

We next needed to give the opportunity for our users to register for the SENCO NPQ.  

Within the registration flow we introduced new SENCO-specific questions to give policy extra information on those registering for the course. Included in these additions was a new flow for users which allowed them to express an interest in completing an NPQ and sign-up for email updates for when the registration service opens. [Read more about the partially closed service](/register-for-an-npq/partial-closure/). 

We added a question asking when users intend to start their NPQ course (which cohort, such as ‘before November 2024’). This is to help manage registrations so that users register at the correct time. 

These new features were also part of our usability testing. 

#### List of changes: 

1. Created a new SENCO guidance page on gov.uk 

2. SENCO course added to the 'choose an NPQ' question

3. SENCO-specific questions added to the registration flow:  

    - ‘Do you work as a special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO)?’. There were two variations of one of the answer options to this question: “No, but I plan to become one” or “No, but I plan to become one within 18 months”. We tested these answers and found that users preferred the former option. 

    - ‘When did you become a SENCO?’ 

4. General question added to the registration flow:

    - “Do you want to start a course before November 2024?” [will change depending on time of year] 
 
5. Closed service page and expression of interest changes: 

    - Users can get an identity or sign in to their DfE Identity account to request email updates to tell them when registration opens. 

    - Also asked ‘Do you want to complete the special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) NPQ when registration reopens?’ 

## Usability study findings 

A usability study of the SENCO guidance page and changes to the registration flow demonstrated a few high-level findings: 

- Most of the journey was well-understood and straight forward for participants. 

- Many users start on the [Transition to national professional qualification for special educational needs co-ordinators](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mandatory-qualification-for-sencos/transition-to-national-professional-qualification-for-special-educational-needs-co-ordinators) page before finding the [SENCO NPQ guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/special-educational-needs-co-ordinators-national-professional-qualification) page. 

- Some users would have liked a bit more detail and information on the NPQ for SENCOs guidance page.  

- The [Apply for a NPQ](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-national-professional-qualification-npq) guidance page could have been a little clearer – particularly the process of how to register for a NPQ. 

- Participants found that making an expression of interest was ‘easy to use’ and ‘useful’.
