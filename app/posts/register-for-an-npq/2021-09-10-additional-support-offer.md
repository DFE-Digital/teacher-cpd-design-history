In addition to the reformed suite of NPQs, the department is introducing an additional support offer for new headteachers from autumn 2021. This is a targeted support package for teachers new to the role of headship.

## Eligibility

Teachers are eligible for this targeted support package if they meet the following criteria:

- are in their first 24 months of headship
- work in a state-funded school in England upon starting the training
- have either completed an NPQH before taking up their first headship post or are currently taking the NPQH
- have not withdrawn from the additional support programme previously

## Design

Two design approaches have been taken:

1. To include ASO in the list of courses, while also highlighting that a teacher may qualify for it if they choose an NPQH
2. Asking upfront at the beginning of the journey if they are looking for an ASO

Both approaches follow up with the same questions:

- Are you a headteacher?
- Are you in your first 2 years of a headship
