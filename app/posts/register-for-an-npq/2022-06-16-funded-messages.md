## Current funding message 

Previously, the funded message for those who would receive DfE scholarship funding was vague, because there we could not guarantee that providers would deem the user suitable for the course. We therefore added this as a clear caveat in the H1 and also used the page as an opportunity to flag that a user could only be accepted on one NPQ once. 

We also created a version for early years and childcarers, with a tweak in the content as they would only be funded for the NPQEYL.

## Non funded messages for those who had already received funding  

The NPQ policy is that a participant can only be funded for one NPQ once. It was decided that the most viable way to identify if a participant had already received funding for that NPQ, was if they had an acceptance declaration against them.

We identified a need to tell users who had already been accepted for an NPQ that they would not receive funding based on two main scenarios:

- They had ‘unofficially withdrawn’ from the course last year and not been made aware of the implications.
- They had wanted to apply for an NPQ with multiple providers or they had changed their mind about which provider and a provider from an earlier registration had already accepted them without their knowledge.

For the first scenario we signposted users to support and for the second, suggested they contact the provider who had accepted them. We also added a prompt suggesting they could apply for another NPQ. 

## Other non-funded messages

As we had created messages for those users who had already been funded, we also decided to look at other scenarios of why users would not be funded.

We designed a non-funded message for those participants whose workplace didn’t meet the eligibility criteria (e.g. a private school, workplaces not in England or early year or childcare professionals that did not have the right registration details).

We also designed an additional non-funded message for early years and childcare professionals who were trying to apply for an NPQ that was not the NPQEYL.
