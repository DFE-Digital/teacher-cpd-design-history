title: Full registration  v1
description: First draft of the full registration journey taking place on the NPQ service
date: 2021-01-27
---
We iterated on the DfE first registration flow to create a flow that is entirely on the DfE service. The main change to this is that it needs to include the questions that providers typically ask - usually about why a teacher want to do the course.

We chose to use the questions from Teach First as they have the most and longest questions. This will help us understand user reaction to this and to create a discussion with providers about how personalised these questions need to be.


## User needs

<b>As a teacher </b>
I need to register interest and apply for an NPQ course at my chosen provider<br />
<b>As a teacher </b> 
I need to provide the correct data about myself in the application form (TRN, DOB, Names)
