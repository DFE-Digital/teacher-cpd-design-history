## Why we decided to iterate  

Recent policy changes made teachers from independent schools with free childcare provision eligible for funding for the NPQ for Early Years Leadership (NPQEYL). These schools appear are registered with GIAS so they can be found through the school journey.

Teachers from independent schools might identify themselves as school teachers as well as early years teachers, so we updated both journeys (see the flow image).

## What we did

### Updated the flow for school teachers

Even though we didn't make any changes to the user journey for school teachers to account for independent schools, we did add extra logic to the flow to allow these users to receive funding for the NPQEYL.

### Updated the flow for early years teachers

For users who choose to go through the early years path we made the following changes:
1. Removed the question "Do you work in a nursery?" since pre-school classes that are part of a school might not be considered nurseries.
2. Updated the option "Pre-school class that’s part of a school" to "Pre-school class or nursery that’s part of a school (maintained or independent)" to account for independent school users.
3. Added the option "I do not work in a nursery" to account for users who would have answered "No" to "Do you work in a nursery?"
