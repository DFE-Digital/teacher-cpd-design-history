## Why we decided to iterate  

Given that the DfE only fund users who live in England we decided to simplify the page in which we ask users where they work. As confirmed by the Policy team, we don't need to capture specific regions in the UK.

## What we did

### Changed the question "Where do you work?"

We replaced the question "Where do you work?" with "Do you work in England?". If the user doesn't work in England they see a text input field where they can type the country or British Crown dependency they work in.
