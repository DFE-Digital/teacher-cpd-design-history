We needed to create a new NPQ admin console after separating from ECF in November 2024. 

In the new admin console we ensured that admins can: 

* change an applicant’s teacher reference number (TRN)
* adjust an applicant’s funding eligibility
* revert applications to pending

## Context

Separating from ECF meant that admins did not have access to all the features they were used to for managing applications. In this period they struggled to:

* correct applicant errors such as incorrect TRNs 
* resolve funding eligibility issues
* reset applications so that they can be reevaluated

We've now reintroduced the functionality they need to manage applications effectively.

## What admins can now do 

### Change TRNs

Admins can change TRNs using the admin console. 

This is essential because applicants sometimes submit incorrect TRNs.

### Adjust funding eligibility

We added a funding override function, allowing admins to adjust funding eligibility and record reasons for changes.

Adjustments are often needed due to complex rules or exceptional circumstances.

### Revert applications to pending

Admins can reset applications that were incorrectly processed, so that they can be reevaluated. 

This means that they can restart workflows when needed.


## Outcome

Admins reported a seamless transition back to full functionality.

Enabling admins to do these tasks minimised the disruption caused by the separation from ECF.

We're now less reliant on software developers to carry out these tasks.


## Next steps

We will:

* continue to gather feedback from admins to refine these features
* look at how we could automate TRN corrections or funding adjustments
* explore other areas to improve the admin console
