To ensure fairness towards the new providers awarded contracts in Spring, the NPQ registration will temporarily close. Whilst it is closed, we want to capture any user who is interested in taking an NPQ, so that we can notify them when registration reopens.

There are two states:

**Before March 11th**
There is a soft closure, where delayed registrations for users taking an NPQ in February can still be completed. Users who do not have a delayed registration and will be part of the Autumn cohort, will have the option to sign up for notifications.

**After March 11th**
Registration will be fully closed and users visiting the service will have the option to sign up for notifications.
