See [this post](/register-for-an-npq/registration-status/) for background on the initial design. 

After a round of research and more in depth conversations with the development team, the following changes were made. 

## 1. Funding status 

### The problem

- Users did not know what the different types of funding were.
- The registration status gave no explanation for the status.

> I dont know what targeted or scholorship funded is? Terminology used to be 'fully funded' or 'DfE funded'.

### Design changes 

1. Different versions of the registration page (the landing page for users who have already registered for an NPQ) have been created, showing the different possible funding statuses a user would see. 

2. The status names have been updated to reflect the langauge used on the outcome pages during the registration flow. They are now: 
  - Eligible 
  - Not eligible 
  - Eligibility in review 

3. Additional text has been added below the status to explain what it means for them. For Not eligible we also so the reason they are not eligible. This uses the same language as in the registration flow but a the shorter version. 

4. We only show the row for Targeted support funding if the user is eligible. This matches the registration flow. We believe users are not that aware of this funding and that it would be confusing to show this information if they are not receiving it.
