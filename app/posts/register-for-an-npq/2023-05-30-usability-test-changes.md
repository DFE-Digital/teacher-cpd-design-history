## Problem statement

Users who change their employment after registering for an NPQ need to raise a ticket with support to be able to update their details. This increases the work of support agents.

## Design

We have designed a journey so the user can self-serve when they need to update their work details. The journey below shows the process the user needs to follow to make the changes.

The screens are the same screens they go through in the registration process. The journey will depend on the type of work setting the user works in (as it is in the registration journey).

Once they've made all the changes, they can amend the work details in the check and confirm page (see screenshot).

Finally, once they complete the changes they can go back to the registration status page using the link on the confirmation page (see screenshot "Confirmation page").
