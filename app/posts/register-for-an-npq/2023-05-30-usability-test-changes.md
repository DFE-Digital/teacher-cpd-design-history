## 1. Improving the start page

### The problem

Users do not always understand the purpose of creating a DfE Identity account, or that they can log back in. 

In usability sessions, we saw:
1. Users skim through this page quickly or don't read it.
2. Users were slightly confused when they landed on the 'Create a DfE Identity account' after pressing on the 'Start now' button. This took them to a different service with no mention of NPQs. One user wanted more information about NPQs. 
3. Users who had already registered for an NPQ struggled to see where to go from the Start page. The 'Start now' button didn't resonate with them. 

### Design changes 

To reduce the potential 'shock' of being passed over to a different service, a grey box ties together the 'Start now' button with text about creating a DfE Identity account. This will hopefully lead to more users reading that text and understanding what happens next in the flow. 

The two other sentences that were above the 'Start now' button have been moved into the 'You need to know' list. This helps chunk up the content and makes it easier for users to scan the page to find the parts that are relevant to them. 

Below the 'Start now' button a 'View your registration' section has been added. This provides a way for users who have already registered to log in to their account and explains what they will be able to do, or see, in their account.
