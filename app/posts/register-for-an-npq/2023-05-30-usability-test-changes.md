## 1. Improving the start page

### The problem

Users do not always understand the purpose of creating a DfE Identity account, or that they can log back in. 

In usability sessions, we saw:

1. Users skim through this page quickly or don't read it.
2. Users were slightly confused when they landed on the 'Create a DfE Identity account' after pressing on the 'Start now' button. This took them to a different service with no mention of NPQs. One user wanted more information about NPQs. 
3. Users who had already registered for an NPQ struggled to see where to go from the start page. The 'Start now' button didn't resonate with them. 

### Design changes 

To reduce the potential 'shock' of being passed over to a different service, we have added: 

- a bullet point under 'use this service to' to tell users it is also for completed registrations 
- a grey box that ties together the 'Start now' button with text about creating a DfE Identity account

### Other design ideas

We considered adding a 'View your registration' section below the 'Start now' button. The idea behind this was to use language that users might be scanning the page fo to help them find what they were looking for. This option would also reduce the number of steps in the flow as we could take users directly to the sign in email page of the DfE Identity account flow. 

We decided to test the other changes as a first step and return to this if users are still struggling to find what they are looking for. 

## 2. Moving the confirmation message

### The problem 

In usability testing users were not clear what to do after completing their registration. The content seems contradictory to some (some think they're done). Users need to know that they still need to complete an application with their chosen provider. 

Users all told us they would check the details of the registration. From the confirmation page there was no way to do this. 

> It makes me nervous that I still have to apply. It's where it went wrong last time. 

> After confirmation I would check the details of registration.

> It says I've registered but reading this seems confusing bc its telling me to go apply with the provider but it is off-putting having to put in same details in another website. Would be better if it was done via ambition all together and done via a code with NPQ Reg Service or vice versa, seems repetitive. 

### Design changes

1. Confirmation page removed
2. User is taken to the registration details page in the user account after completing a registration where they can check their registration
3. A success message is shown at the top of the registration page 
4. Provider application status shows the next steps to take - apply with provider is always the status shown after completing a registration
5. The feedback link is in the process of moving to the phase banner.
