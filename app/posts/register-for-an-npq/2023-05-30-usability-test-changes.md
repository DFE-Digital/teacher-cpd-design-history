## 1. Improving the start page

### The problem

Users do not always understand the purpose of creating a DfE Identity account, or that they can log back in. 

In usability sessions, we saw:

1. Users skim through this page quickly or don't read it.
2. Users were slightly confused when they landed on the 'Create a DfE Identity account' after pressing on the 'Start now' button. This took them to a different service with no mention of NPQs. One user wanted more information about NPQs. 
3. Users who had already registered for an NPQ struggled to see where to go from the Start page. The 'Start now' button didn't resonate with them. 

### Design changes 

To reduce the potential 'shock' of being passed over to a different service, we have added: 

- a bullet point under 'use this service to' to tell users it is also for completed registrations 
- a grey box that ties together the 'Start now' button with text about creating a DfE Identity account

### Other design ideas

We considered adding a 'View your registration' section below the 'Start now' button. The idea behind this was to use language that users might be scanning the page fo to help them find what they were looking for. This option would also reduce the number of steps in the flow as we could take users directly to the sign in email page of the DfE Identity account flow. 

We decided to test the other changes as a first step and return to this if users are still struggling to find what they are looking for.
