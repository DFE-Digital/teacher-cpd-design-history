## Background

We are no longer able to provide scholarship funding for all national professional qualifications (NPQs). In response to this, policy personnel have been involved in reviewing and iterating the scholarship funding eligibility criteria for NPQ courses.  

The following NPQs are still fully funded for eligible teachers and leaders working in publicly funded schools and 16 to 19 settings: 

- headship 

- early headship coaching offer 

- leading primary maths 

- special educational needs coordinators (SENCOs) 

### NPQs with targeted scholarships  

If you are: 

- in the top 50% of schools with the highest proportion of pupils who attract pupil premium funding; 

- a 16 to 19 setting identified as having high disadvantage; or 

- a highly disadvantaged early years setting 

The following NPQs are fully funded for eligible teachers and leaders: 

- early years leadership (for the EYL NPQ only) 

- executive leadership 

- leading behaviour and culture 

- leading literacy 

- leading teacher development 

- leading teaching 

- senior leadership 

To implement these changes, we needed to close the service on 2 April 2024 and make key updates to the NPQ Register service and gov.uk guidance. 

Closing the service also gave us the opportunity to review registrations that were in the system. We asked course providers to confirm which registrations had not ‘started’ so that we can update the service. This meant that old registrations that had not started a NPQ course would not progress using the old eligibility rules. 

## Changes we made 

We already had an approach to how we would close the service completely (in case of any required service maintenance). However, we’ve never needed to present the service as partially closed. 

Partial closure meant that users could: 

- not register for a NPQ unless they had permission to complete a late registration 

- still sign in to their DfE Identity account and review NPQs they’d previously registered for 

- request email updates about the status of the registration service 

- express an interest in completing the new SENCO NPQ  

### Guidance 

We removed the registration link from all individual course pages but kept that link in the ‘Apply’ and ‘Funding’ guidance pages. This was to create a linear journey where the user is encouraged to choose the NPQ course and course provider before registering and applying for the NPQ. 

### Register service (start page)  

We notified users that the registration service had ‘closed temporarily’. 

We also gave them the opportunity to request an email to notify them of when the service is open again and to register their interest in the new SENCO NPQ course. 

For those who requested email notifications, it was important to highlight that by doing so they are once again, agreeing to the terms in our privacy policy. Line added: ‘By requesting email updates, you agree to our privacy notice.’ 

The privacy notice link explains the type of data we will collect and how we will use it. 

For those users who answered, ‘yes’ to the question ‘Do you want to register for the special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) NPQ when registration opens?’- we used that information to help us gain an understanding of how many users would be interested in completing the SENCO course.  

Although most users were unable to register for a NPQ, they were still able to check on existing registrations by signing into their DfE Identity account. 

#### Register for a NPQ start page:

### Request email updates flow 

1. If a user wants to receive an email to tell them when the service is open to make a registration, they can select the ‘Request email updates’ button on the closed version of the Register start page. 

2. The service will ask them to sign in to their DfE Identity account. 

3. Whilst choosing to receive email updates, we also ask ‘Do you want to register for the special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) NPQ when registration opens?’ This helps us understand how many people wanted to complete the SENCO NPQ and later create tailored email comms to inform them that the service is open - so those with a mandatory need to do the course get access to the funded places.  

4. Users can choose either ‘Yes’ or ‘No, I want to do a different NPQ’ and then ‘Request email updates’ button to continue. We have a confirmation page to tell the user that the emails have been set up, which is followed by a confirmation email. Those who opt in are added to an 'Email subscription list’ in the admin panel.  

5. In the ‘Get help’ section of the email updates, we have a link ‘Unsubscribe from email updates’ that allows users to opt out of receiving any further email updates. 

We built a section within our admin panel which captures the email address of those who signed up to our email updates and their interest in registering for the SENCO NPQ. This has allowed us to: 

- update our policy teams with the number of those who have shown interest in completing the new SENCO course 

- send follow up emails that support users to register for NPQs when the service reopens

#### Request email updates and register an interest in SENCO NPQ:

There are 2 radio buttons, with the option of 'Yes' or 'No, I want to do a different NPQ'.](/register-for-an-npq/2024-03-30-partial-closure/senco-interest-question.png)

#### Confirmation page once the emails have been set up:

#### Email confirmation that users have signed up to email updates:

### Late registration 

Despite the service being closed, a small number of users were given access to register for a NPQ if they:  

- have been delayed in getting their teaching reference number (TRN) or 

- were taking the early headship coaching offer or 

- made an error in their initial registration and needed to submit a new one. 

How users were able to make a late registration: 

1. Providers send DfE a list of who needs to make a registration before the service reopens. 

2. The provider engagement team add the user’s email address to the admin panel and inform the course provider that the user has been added. 

3. The provider then sends a link to the user that allows them to access our service to make a late registration. (link only accessible to those granted permission in the admin panel). 

4. Users access this link by signing into their DfE Identity account using the same email address shared with the provider engagement team. If the email address does not match, the user is shown an error message.

5. Users are given general information about NPQ course start dates and asked ‘Do you want to start a course before November 2024?’  

If the user answered: 

- ‘Yes’- they proceeded to register for a NPQ using the service as usual 

- ‘No, I want to start later’- they were told to return later in the year to register 

#### Late registration start page:

This is very similar to the normal start page, but at the top it has the heading "Register late for a national professional qualification (NPQ)" followed by "You’ve been given access to make a late registration for a NPQ whilst the service is closed. You will also need to apply separately with your training provider, if you have not done so already."](/register-for-an-npq/2024-03-30-partial-closure/late-registration-start-page.png)

#### Adding a user in the admin panel:  

![Screenshot of the admin tool where a user can be added to make a late registration. There is a form to enter the persons email address and an 'Add user' button. Below this is a list of the added users, showing their email address, whether they have a DfE identity account, the date of their most recently submitted registration and a link to remove access.](/register-for-an-npq/2024-03-30-partial-closure/admin-tool-late-registration-users.png)

## Future considerations

Perhaps we could think about how we reduce the need for users to make a late NPQ registration. If it is a necessary feature when closing the service, maybe we could automate the process rather than managing late registrations manually.
