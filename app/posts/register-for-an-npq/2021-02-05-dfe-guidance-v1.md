title: DfE guidance  v1
description: Guidance using an accordion pattern. Could be hosted on NPQ service

The same content as the GDS mainstream version, just using a different pattern. The pages are based on the user needs from discovery. 

We have deliberately kept the copy to the basics as we want the users to tell us what is missing/what else they need during research. 


## User needs

To easily find and access information about NPQs<br />

<b>As a teacher </b>

To understand if I'm eligible for funding<br />
<b>As a teacher </b> 
To understand who provides NPQs
