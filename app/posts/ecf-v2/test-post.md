## Test post

This is a test post.

Currently, there are problems with the digital services that facilitate the early career framework (ECF) policy reforms. These issues prevent the services from serving their core purposes, defined later in this document. There is more information [about these core purposes and the issues impacting them in a previous design history entry](https://teacher-cpd.design-history.education.gov.uk/cross-programme/our-refreshed-vision/).
