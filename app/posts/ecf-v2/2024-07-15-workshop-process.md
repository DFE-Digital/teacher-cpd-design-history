title: The process behind our problem prioritisation and ideation workshops
description: "Our journey of prioritising problems and developing high level solutions to take forward"

Over the last month our team ran several workshops.

We aimed to:
* consolidate, prioritise and better understand the top problems across the digital services that facilitate the early career framework (ECF) policy reforms
* ideate on solutions for these problems

This consisted of five problem workshops and two ideation workshops.

## How we approached the problem prioritisation exercise

### Identified the problems to focus on

We achieved this by looking at:
* historic user research insights across ECF related teams
* analysing Zendesk support tickets for schools
* analysing the lead provider API error log

### Chose the top high level problems that each user group faced

Our user groups for the service are the following:

* Lead Providers 
* Schools
* Appropriate bodies
* DFE internal users

### Held problems workshops for each user group

 In these workshops, we voted for each problem on:

*	the problem being a root problem or symptom of a bigger problem
*	the problem's impact on users and severity of said impact
*	the problem's feasibility
*	the problem's sequencing risk
*	if solving the problem would promote flexibility
*	the likelihood of fixing the problem using ECF related digital services alone 
*	if solving the problem promotes flexibility

Once the voting was complete, we were able to see which of the problems we should treat as a higher priority based on the scores. The team then ideated possible solutions for these problems at the end of each workshop. This was the starting point for the ideation exercise.

## How we approached the ideation exercise
To further ideate on how to solve the problems we had identified, we:
*	gathered all the solutions the team came up with for ideation
*	kept them colour coded to show which user group and problem the solution was in response to 
*	grouped them loosely into large categories e.g. communications or data
*	further filtered the groups into more specific solutions e.g. Improving and fixing the data model/ Researching comms with users and how we communicate changes
*	conducted a scope exercise with our product manager to determine which of the solutions were: **in scope for our services MVP**, **out of scope for MVP** and **completely out of scope for our service**
*	began the process with the wider team and discussed if everyone agreed with where the solutions were placed in terms of scope and if they had any other solutions to add
*	finally, voted on the solutions we deemed in scope against their feasibility, impact theyâ€™d have on all our users, and how far they met the service's core purpose

We were able to end the workshop with a clear idea of our high level solutions allowing us to move forward with road mapping for [our MVP.](https://teacher-cpd.design-history.education.gov.uk/ecf-v2/initial-release-of-ecf-2/)

### What were the results of the workshop?

Based on our analysis of problems & needs, we considered 26 ideas and narrowed it down to 10 for MVP:

*	improve and fix the data model
*	improve how schools accounts are created and the rules around them
*	show the right data over the Lead provider API (e.g. a teacher's induction start date)
*	have the right rules and validation in the digital service to represent the policy and meet the needs of users
*	rename and restructure services and key terms for users or parts of the service
*	improve the API documentation
*	create improved ways for schools and lead providers to make changes to ECT and mentor records, rather than support or developers
*	make the journey of registering ECTs and mentors with DFE more intuitive for schools and help them understand their wider responsibilities
*	 join and improve finance and admin tooling for internal users
*	create timelines for participants
