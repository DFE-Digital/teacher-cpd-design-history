## Why we wanted to try and created a dashboard for school users after sign in

We originally wanted to try and create a dashboard for school users after sign in to help schools by:
- reassuring them they've done what they needed to do to register early career teachers (ECTs) and their mentors
- make clear the purpose of the digital service and what they needed to do
- prompt them to take certain actions when necessary, such as assigning a mentor to an ECT
