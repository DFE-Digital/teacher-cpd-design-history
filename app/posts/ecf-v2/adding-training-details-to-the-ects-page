## Why we did this

In testing, some schools said that when they registered their early career teachers (ECTs), it was 'too late' when they were seeing the details for the lead provider, delivery partner and appropriate body they were working with. They wanted to be able to see quickly and upfront who they were.

We think this is because:

- the delivery model for the early career teacher training entitlement (ECTE) is complex
- there's a few different organisational roles schools work with for training or induction, and it can be difficult to remember them all
- it helps reassure school users that the information in Register ECTs is correct

A lead provider also told us this would be helpful for them as schools often screenshot the first page when they sign in to send to them for help. However, given it doesn't include the lead provider they work with, it means it misses key information needed for that lead provider to assist them.

As part of this work, we also decided to remove the filters on the page. We believed we didn't have a strong need for them yet given the vast majority of schools should only have 1 or 2 ECTs per year. Whilst there may be some historic records, we think by sorting the records by when they were registered and if they need a mentor assigning we'll avoid any issues here. We'll reconsider adding filters later if we discover a greater need for it.

## What we've done

We originally had a design that was more similar to the older service Manage training for ECTs. It showed a list of ECTs with a search and filter.

Now, as explained above, we've added the fields showing the ECT's:

- lead provider
- delivery partner
- appropriate body

This makes showing an individual ECT's record a lot larger, but we'll monitor if this causes any issues over time. 

We hope by adding this information, it gives schools a better understanding of the different organisational roles involved in induction and early career teacher training programmes. It will also help better highlight when there are inconsistencies or mistakes that need to be rectified by the school.
