## Why weâ€™re doing this

In ECF1, there's a lot of research to suggest schools don't fully understand mentor training. They're usually focused - understandably - on the training of early career teachers.

When schools think of mentors, they're typically thinking of how they work with an ECT and 'mentor' them. Not training they might receive to improve as a mentor.

This has made asking questions or giving information around mentor training typically very difficult.

We wanted to look at the problems here and how we might solve them to give clearer information to schools on mentor training, so mentors can be onboarded and start training efficiently.
