## Why we’re doing this

Currently in ECF1 school users repeat the same questions in the journey for all their ECT registrations despite a some of the answers often being the same. As part of our aim to reduce the length of the registering an ECT journey, we proposed adding a default programme choice feature in which school users could save the details of their AB/DP/LP for future ECT registrations as we can use the data provided as their default.

## What we tested

When a school user registers their first ECTs details they will be prompted to input the programme type (provider led/FIP or school led CIP/DIY), the Delivery partner name, Lead provider name and Appropriate body.

Once they provide their details for the first ECT they register we tested a screen that asked if they would like to save the details provided for the future registrations. This doesn’t block users in future if they have an ECT with differing programme details to the default choice, they will have the option to manually input, but in most cases, schools will have consistent details for the majority of their ECTs.

## How it tested and next steps

Research found that this feature mainly tested well, and school users knew what to do when interacting with the screen. However, some users mistook it as a ‘check your answers' page so we are looking into iterating the heading to make the purpose clearer for our users.
