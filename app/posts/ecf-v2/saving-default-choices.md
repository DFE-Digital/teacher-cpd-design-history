## Why we’re doing this

Currently in ECF1 school users repeat the same questions in the journey for all their ECT registrations despite a some of the answers often being the same. As part of our aim to reduce the length of the registering an ECT journey, we proposed adding a default programme choice feature in which school users could save the details of their AB/DP/LP for future ECT registrations as we can use the data provided as their default.

## What we tested

When a school user registers their first ECT's details, they will be prompted to input the:
- programme type
- appropriate body
- lead provider
- delivery partner

Once they provide their details for the first ECT they register, we  asked if they would like to save the details provided for future registrations of ECTs and mentors. This doesn’t block users in future if they have an ECT or mentor with differing programme details to the default choice. They will have the option to manually input these details, but in most cases, schools will have consistent details for the majority.```

## How it tested and next steps

Research found that this feature mainly tested well, and school users knew what to do when interacting with the screen. However, some users mistook it as a ‘check your answers' page so we are looking into iterating the heading to make the purpose clearer for our users.
