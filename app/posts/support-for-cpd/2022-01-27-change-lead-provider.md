This is a first pass at attempting to create a journey for support agents to change a school’s lead provider.

This is the journey for when a school has decided to switch from their current provider, given that:

- they have a current provider
- the current provider has submitted declarations

It is different to the ‘challenge’ journey, which is used at the beginning of a partnership, if something was not set up correctly.
