## Why we decided to iterate

### Issues affecting responsive display and accessibility

As part of ongoing reviews of interfaces designed for DfE contract management teams who support lead providers, a number of display issues were found on the ECF and NPQ financial statements.

When users sign in to the service to view financial statements on mobile devices, or smaller viewports, they were presented with a broken UI where content was either illegible or hidden.

Our aim was to fix these issues, so that all content is readily accessible across all devices and platforms, providing users with a mobile-friendly experience.


## What we did

1. We fixed the display issues by using Chromeâ€™s dev tools to inspect the live service and write new HTML and CSS media queries.
2. We updated the LPDOB service prototype to reflect the live service. This had, due to the pace of delivery, become out of date. This now allows our team a more efficient workflow between design and development.

## What we learned

### Improved ways of working 

Some UI issues were still showing after the updated code had been published. This happened as the ways of working at the time excluded any official design review post deployment. Our team has since implemented post-dev design checks, which has proven successful and is one of the most valuable outcomes from this work.

### The need for design histories 

This work re-emphasised the importance of keeping design histories up-to-date. While we appreciate this should always be the case, we also understand that pace of delivery and staff turnover affects design history ownership. We want to ensure all significant design decisions are documented and, as new members of the team, we will be advocating for this going forward. 

{% from "govuk/components/inset-text/macro.njk" import govukInsetText %}
{{ govukInsetText({
  text: "For example, during the review we noticed that the ECF and NPQ financial statements had been designed and built independently, each statement using different HTML and CSS code. As no design history had been documented on the rationale for this, it was not clear why there was inconsistency or why they were not designed to be mobile friendly."
}) }}

### Continued iteration 

The overall designs of the current financial statements are still not ideal, both in terms of content and UI. A more holistic statement redesign including a number of improvements is on our road map for 2023.

## Next steps 

The UCD team will be redesigning the statements to allow for new functionality and standardisation across both ECF and NPQ. This will include the functionality for contract managers and finance teams to add adjustments and to view uplifts and clawbacks within monthly statements.
